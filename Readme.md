#Evidence Based Scheduling

This is an Excel Macro program that helps project when a milestone/release will be completed.  The program is intended for use by Agile teams that are or intend to track team velocity.

Input a set of actual velocities your team has taken over time.  Then give the estimated size of the next major milestone.  This application will tell you the projected time it will take to complete the milestone.
